f(1, 2)

1. create a new state 
    - globals 
    - a = 1 b = 2 (in local)
2. runState block (TODO) new state 

        add z as function to new state 

** explicit global keyword for global definitions 
** local table checked first 
** idea 2: functions can only access global state and local (argument) variables
** tables pass by reference everything else pass by value

** function return -> delete local mappings and move forward with that as state
